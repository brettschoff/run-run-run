# Run?, Run. Run!

## Description

Welcome to Run?, Run, Run! where you can race against the computer in a random event race. Through a lot of Javascript and some CSS and HTML I was able to make a racing game where you are having obstacles thrown at you that will either hinder you or help you. Right now there are currently only 8 random events that you may encounter.

## How to Play!

When you first load up the game you will want to hit the <button>Go!</button>

Once you have dones this the race is on! It begins with your turn the player is the white game piece and the computer is the black game piece. To start your turn you will need to roll the dice with the <button>Roll the dice</button>

After the dice have been rolled you will move that amount and a random event will occur. Read the events carefully as some require input.

Once you finish your event you will get the <button>End your turn</button> This will move it to the computers turn. The game will end once either the player or the computer reaches tile 300. If you want to check your tile or your modifiers simply hover over your game piece, you can also check the computers aswell the same way.

## Current Modifiers:
### Speed
Speed grants extra movement based on its modifier. It can also slow you down if it drops down into the negatives.
